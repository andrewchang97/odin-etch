Beginning etch-a-sketch project on 8/9/23# odin-etch

finished project on 8/9/23. The final thing I did was add the playerChoice from a prompt into the 
grid by making i = playerChoice and j = playerChoice. Doing so created a grid that would 
be as even as possible and I made sure it was a percentage that would hold even with 
the others. Overall I don't feel awful about my code.
